I am currently a master researcher at the AIoT Lab within the institution of Data and Information, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xinlei Chen](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/cxl_en/main.htm). Prior to that, received the B.E. degree of Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Northwest University](https://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in China, and the B.S. degree of Electronic System Engineering from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) in UK, in 2022. 

My current work focuses on advancing sensing, control, edge computing within lightweight drone-based systems. I enjoy building proof-of-concepts for innovative applications, encompassing **both hardware and software** aspects.
