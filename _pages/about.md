I am currently a master researcher at the AIoT Lab within the institution of Data and Information, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xinlei Chen](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/cxl_en/main.htm). Prior to that, received the B.E. degree of Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Northwest University](https://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in China, and the B.S. degree of Electronic System Engineering from [University of Essex]() in UK, in 2022. 

My current work focuses on advancing sensing, control, edge computing within lightweight drone-based systems. I enjoy building proof-of-concepts for innovative applications, encompassing **both hardware and software** aspects. My **research interests** include *Mobile Computing*, *Cyber-Physical Systems*, *Robotics*, *Distributed&Embedded AI* and *Quadrotors*.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
